It's time to put all of the HTML knowledge I have been acquiring so far into practice. In the project, I am going to build a basic recipe website.

The website will consist of a main page index which will have links to a few recipes. The website won't look very pretty by the time I've finished. Not unless I'm into brutalist web design, that is.

But it's important to keep in mind that this project is just to build my HTML chops; I will revisit this project in the future to style it up with CSS.
